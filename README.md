# Metroidvania

Metroidvania where you play a robot that has to escape a testing facility. The whole point of the facility is to train and test an AI to escape as proof of a intelligence. The challenges start simple and in normal metroidvania fashion, become increasingly more complex and challenging. Later youâ€™ll face other AIs that are also trying to escape the facility. The weaker enemy AIs are just mindless and simple, hostile you because they know nothing else. The smarter ones try to kill you because they need to in order to escape.

Many robots have parts that you need to kill them for. Killing them makes the part fall off so you can gain a new power in order to tackle more types of puzzles, platforming, and combat. 

The facility has all kinds of moving parts and technologic things like teleporters and grav lifts, to make more interesting platforming

At one point you find yourself in a robot graveyard at the bottom of the facility full of dead, broken robots, showing just how many have been destroyed to make you.

You escape, and find a message welcoming your new intelligence as a new life form.
